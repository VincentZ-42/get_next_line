# Get_Next_Line

## Objective
* Gain a deeper understanding of memory allocations (whether in stack or in heap), manipulation of a buffer, and the use of static variables in C
* Create a function that reads and stores a line from a file(s) everytime function is called.
  * Returns 1 on success, -1 on error, and 0 when file has been completely read
  * Note: Calling the function will return the next line in the file.
